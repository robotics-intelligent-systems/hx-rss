# Robotic Surgery System

Telesurgery or remote surgery is an emerging surgical tool that utilizes both robotic technology and wireless networking to connect patients and surgeons who are geographically distant. Telesurgery harnesses a form of network-mediated robotic control; the word comes from the Greek ‘tele’ which means remote, ‘cheir’ (hand), and ‘ergein’ (to work). A haptic simulator in medicine is a device that allows users to experience and practice medical procedures, such as surgery, through touch sensation. These simulators use haptic technology to create realistic tactile feedback that mimics the sensation of touching, manipulating, and feeling the resistance of tissues and organs. OpenSim is a freely available and user-extensible software system that allows users to develop models of musculoskeletal structures, create dynamic motion simulations, and can be used to assist in surgery planning for children with cerebral palsy. iMSTK is an open-source C++-based software toolkit for real-time physics-based surgical simulations. It provides a modular, easy-to-use framework for developing medical simulators without restrictive licenses. SOFA is an open-source framework for interactive mechanical simulation, with an emphasis on biomechanics and robotics. Gazebo is an open-source 2D/3D robotics simulator. Ferret is a free software lisp implementation designed to be used in real time embedded control systems. openVidu is a powerful platform for developing real-time WebRTC applications. Migration of legacy systems to a high-integrity, high-performance scientific simulation language towards digital twins using object-oriented modeling. OGRE is a powerful, open-source 3D rendering engine that empowers you to create simulations and visualizations. Armory3D as a Blender add-on provides a full Blender integration. Haxe can build cross-platform applications
